# strapi-provider-upload-mega

Mega provider for strapi upload

## Instalation

`npm i strapi-provider-upload-mega`

## Notes
Since Mega stores all the files encrypted you will not be able to use directly the stored URL in your website. In order to decrypt the files I suggest you to use [megajs](https://github.com/qgustavor/mega) module and following [@qgustavor's suggestion](https://github.com/qgustavor/mega/issues/49).
